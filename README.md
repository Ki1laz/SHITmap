As a training tool, in fact, only completed the detection of IP survivability and port opening, the follow-up will add multi-threading, C-segment scanning and other functions and take security into account to do more improvements

##Update SHITmap2.0

Just fixed the BUG that the abnormal result was returned when detecting whether IP was alive or not, and updated the function of C-segment scanning. I hoped to scan ports and C-segment with multiple threads, but it could not be realized due to the limited level.
